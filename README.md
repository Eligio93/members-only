# Members-Only

## Description

Members Only is a messaging application that allows users to write anonymous messages and display them on a bulletin board. Users have different levels of access:
1. USER- Users become a USER after a simple registration and can write anonymous messages.
2. MEMBER - Users have the option to upgrade their status to MEMBER, which allows them to see who wrote a message and when it was posted.
3. ADMIN - Administrators have absolute privileges. They can not only see who wrote a message and when it was posted but also have the ability to delete messages.

## Struggle Points

Initially, the biggest challenge was understanding how Passport works with local strategy in JavaScript. This involved grasping the authentication process for each user and displaying error messages in the views during authentication. As the project progressed, I also encountered difficulties in managing protected pages and implementing controls in different views, adjusting them based on user privileges. Last but not least I had some difficulty assigning and keeping track of the different classes and components, which caused issues during CSS development. 

## Conclusion

In this project, I expanded my knowledge of using Express and authentication methods. Furthermore, it provided me with additional practice in database usage and manipulation. As it's primarily a back-end project, I dedicated less time to the front-end and styling aspects. Therefore, the project features basic graphics and is not responsive. I will certainly return to enhance the overall aesthetics of the application and make it available on mobile devices.
